# GitHub Dark Script [![tag](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark-Script.svg)](https://github.com/StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark-Script/tags)
> GitHub Dark in userscript form, with a settings panel

This script loads and applies the [GitHub Dark](https://github.com/StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark) and adds an option panel to change settings on-the-fly without the need to reinstall. The script is still in development and should be considered alpha-quality.

# Installation
